1) Maximum sum of nodes in Binary tree such that no two are adjacent

Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any children in consideration and vice versa.

2) Find maximum level sum in Binary Tree
Given a Binary Tree having positive and negative nodes, the task is to find maximum sum level in it.
